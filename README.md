# **Election Analysis**
## **Overview** 
---

> Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, has asked us to help conduct an election audit of U.S. Congressional precinct results in Colorado. After receiving the [CSV](https://github.com/annaS000/Election-Analysis/tree/main/Resources) file containing the data, we have been asked to find a list of results including:
>* Total number of votes cast overall
>* Complete lists of the candidates and counties in the election
>* Total number of votes received by each candidate county
>* Percentage of votes per candidate and county
>* County with the Largest Turnout
>* Winner of the election
>> Once we have our results, we can save them to a [text file](https://github.com/annaS000/Election-Analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt) and send over to Tom with out analysis.
